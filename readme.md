Use arrow key movement and select(enter) / back(esc) for navigation of 
CrunchyRoll pages. This is intended to allow you to operate the site 
with a simple Fire TV Remote or similar on a big screen. We also hide 
the top menu bar as you can not operate it with these keys and try to 
maximise the video player including hiding scrollbars.
